TrendStream

Requires:
python 2.5 or greater
python-simplejson
python-tk

Usage:
python ./trendstream.py

TrendStream connects to Twitter, gets a list of trending topics, then opens a
stream on Twitter's Track resource, which means all (or sometimes, a subset of)
all the tweets containing a trending topic are sent to TrendStream.

Each tweet is then displayed on a scrolling history.
